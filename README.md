# 👋 Hey there, I’m Eyad Khedr

I’m a high school student from Egypt exploring the intersection of **AI, software engineering, and real-world impact**. I don’t just code—I create solutions that matter, from health tech to sustainable engineering.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Exploring
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Dementia detection, speech synthesis, and data-driven insights.
- **Software Engineering:** Building Flutter & web apps that solve tangible problems.
- **Entrepreneurship:** Turning ideas into small-scale projects and prototypes.
- **Social Impact:** Using STEM to tackle environmental and health challenges locally.
